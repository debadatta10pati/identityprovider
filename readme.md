This project contains a child process that is being called by a parent process in [https://github.com/debadatta10pati/identityprovider. ](https://github.com/debadatta10pati/identityuser.git)
This is an implementation of the parent-child relationship where the child resides outside of the parent project.

Changes :
1. kmodule.xml is not the default.
2. After deployment, it is used in parent project as a dependency.
